# Victoria 2 Cursed Mod
A Victoria 2 mod that makes the game more cursed. This mod changes the graphics of the game to make it nice and crispy, adding emojis, and generally making for a more cursed experience overall.
 
//TODO insert screenshot here.
 
## Installation instructions:
1. Download the mod by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP.
2. Extract the folder to your game directory. If you use Steam, the folder is mostly likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\commmon\Victoria 2\mod`
3. Go to that folder. You should see a folder named Victoria-2-Cursed-main. Rename that folder to "Cursed", without the quotation marks.
4. Go into the newly renamed Cursed folder and move Cursed.mod up one level to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\commmon\Victoria 2\mod`. This file will mostly likely be identified as a movie file by your computer.
5. Launch the game. You should see "Cursed" as one of the options. Tick it and the mod should load.

This mod is theoretically compatible with any mod that doesn't change a significant amount of Victoria 2's graphics. This includes mods like HPM, HFM, DoD, etc.
